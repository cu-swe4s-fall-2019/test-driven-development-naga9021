Test Driven Development

Created math_lib_test.py to create tests for math_lib.py
Created tests within math_lib_test.py to test code for errors
Wrote tests, ran to see if the code passed tests.
If tests are passed, rewrite tests or write additional tests
If tests fail, proceed to math_lib.py to change code to pass tests
